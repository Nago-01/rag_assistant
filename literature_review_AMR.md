Windels et al , 2019). In order to combat AMR, it is important to
understand both antibiotic tolerance and resistance.
Antibiotic resistance mechanisms
Antibiotic resistance frequently results in delayed adequate antibi-otic treatment, increasing morbidity and mortality. AMR is the

Although AMR has been widely acknowledged as a pressing issue,the incidence of infections and spread of MDR bacteria is still rising.In addition, the increased use of implanted medical devices such asjoint prostheses, artificial heart valves, vascular endoprostheses andpacemakers leads to a higher incidence of biofilm-associated infec-tions, which in turn leads to another important phenomenon: antibi-otic tolerance (Davidson et al, 2019; Gollan et al, 2019). Antibiotic

tolerance enables bacteria to survive antibiotic challenges even whenthey are fully susceptible in standard microbiological assays(Brauner et al, 2016). By using in vitro experiments and mathemati-
cal modelling, Balaban and co-workers recently showed that toler-ance can precede resistance and that tolerance mutations can lead toa rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance (Levin-Reisman et al, 2017;
Windels et al , 2019). In order to combat AMR, it is important to
